## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd packages/server
npm install
cd ../..

# Install client dependencies
cd packages/client
npm install
cd ../..
```

### Configuration

1. Create `.env` file in root `agarFi/` directory:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
MIN_PLAYERS_DEV=2
AUTO_FILL_BOTS=true
SERVER_PORT=3001
```

2. See `ENV_CONFIG.md` for full configuration options.

### Running the Demo

```bash
# From agarFi/ directory

# Option 1: Run both server and client together
npm run dev

# Option 2: Run separately (in different terminals)
# Terminal 1:
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2:
npm run dev:client
```

The game will be available at:
- **Client**: http://localhost:3000
- **Server**: http://localhost:3001

## 🎯 How to Demo

### Single Player Testing

1. **Start the server and client**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open browser**: http://localhost:3000
3. **Enter your name**: Any name you want
4. **Select a game mode**: Click any tier ($1-$100)
5. **Wait for countdown**: Bots will auto-fill to meet minimum (2 players in dev mode)
6. **Game starts**: After 120 seconds or when lobby fills
7. **Play the game**:
   - Move mouse to control your blob
   - Press `SPACE` to split
   - Press `W` to eject mass
   - Eat pellets (small dots) to grow
   - Eat smaller blobs to absorb their mass
8. **Game ends**: Last alive or after 30 minutes
9. **View stats**: See your performance metrics

### Multi-Player Testing

1. **Start server**: `npm run dev:server`
2. **Open multiple browser windows**: http://localhost:3000 in each
3. **Join same tier**: All players select the same game mode
4. **Wait for 10 players** or countdown to complete
5. **Compete**: Play against each other in real-time!

### Testing Different Game Modes

- **$1 Micro**: Quick casual games
- **$5 Low**: Standard gameplay
- **$10 Medium**: Balanced competition
- **$25 High**: Serious matches
- **$50 Very High**: Elite tier
- **$100 Elite**: Maximum stakes
- **🐋 Whale** Mode: Locked (coming in Phase 3)

## 🎮 Controls

### Mouse/Keyboard
- **Move**: Mouse cursor (blob follows)
- **Split**: `SPACE` key
- **Eject Mass**: `W` key

### Touch (Mobile)
- **Move**: Tap/drag on screen
- **Split**: Tap "SPLIT" button (bottom right)
- **Eject**: Tap "EJECT" button (bottom right)

---

## 📊 Understanding Stats

After each game, you'll see these stats:

| Stat | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Food Eaten** | Total pellets consumed |
| **Cells Eaten** | How many players you eliminated |
| **Highest Mass** | Peak size you achieved |
| **Time Survived** | How long you lasted |
| **Leader Time** | Seconds spent as #1 on leaderboard |
| **Best Rank** | Your highest placement during the game |

### Tie-Breakers

If multiple players have the same mass at game end:

1. **Time Survived** (longer wins)
2. **Cells Eaten** (more wins)
3. **Pellets Eaten** (more wins)

---

## 🧪 Development Configuration

### Change Minimum Players

Edit `.env`:

```env
# Require only 2 players for testing
MIN_PLAYERS_DEV=2

# Require 10 players (production-like)
MIN_PLAYERS_DEV=10
```

### Disable Auto-Fill Bots

```env
AUTO_FILL_BOTS=false
```

### Adjust Game Parameters

```env
MAP_WIDTH=5000
MAP_HEIGHT=5000
STARTING_MASS=100
PELLET_COUNT=500
SPATIAL_HASH_GRID_SIZE=200
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

```bash
# Make sure port 3001 is free
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill process if needed
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Client can't connect to server

1. Check server is running: http://localhost:3001/api/health
2. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` in ENV_CONFIG.md
3. Check browser console for errors

### Game is laggy

1. Close other applications
2. Reduce `PELLET_COUNT` in `.env`
3. Check server CPU usage
4. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Bots not spawning

1. Verify `AUTO_FILL_BOTS=true` in `.env`
2. Check server logs for errors
3. Restart server

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Server (60Hz Tick Rate)

- **Physics Engine**: Custom, deterministic
- **Collision Detection**: Spatial hashing (O(n) complexity)
- **Speed Formula**: `2.2 × (32 / sqrt(mass))`
- **Radius Formula**: `sqrt(mass / PI)`
- **Eat Condition**: Predator must be 10% larger

### Client (60fps Rendering)

- **Rendering**: Raw Canvas API (no libraries)
- **Camera**: Follows player blob center
- **Zoom**: Dynamic based on player mass
- **Prediction**: Client-side for smooth movement
- **Sync**: Server-authoritative (server corrects client)

### Network

- **Protocol**: WebSocket via Socket.io
- **Full State**: Every 500ms
- **Delta Updates**: Every ~33ms (30Hz client)
- **Latency Handling**: Client prediction + server reconciliation
